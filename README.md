# PaleoTracer
Program to help visualize trends in terrestrial paleoecology, paleofire regimes and paleoclimatology that makes use of Carbon Isotopic ratios of Bulk Organic Matter (BOM) and complex organic biomarker (PAH, alkanes) from dated paleosol outcrops.  
####
Download repository, save all files in the same repository. Input files must be in excel and in the specified format. There are three input files.
These include the outfile file from the gas chromatograph. A file with the input parameters of the sample during that run.
And a file with corrected isotopic values.
This program is intended to display isotopic ratios, fire intensity, etc over geologic timescales.
