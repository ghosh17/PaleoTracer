THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO CALCULATE, VISUALIZE AND AUTOMATE LABORATORY DATA FROM STABLE ISOTOPES AND MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS PRESERVED IN FOSSILIZED SOILS AND SEDIMENT CORES IN ORDER TO DISCERN TRENDS IN PALEOECOLOGY, PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND PALEOCLIMATES .

Download repository, save all files in the same repository. Input files must be in excel and in the specified format. There are three input files.
These include the outfile file from the gas chromatograph. A file with the input parameters of the sample during that run.
And a file with corrected isotopic values.
This program is intended to display isotopic ratios, fire intensity, etc over geologic timescales.
